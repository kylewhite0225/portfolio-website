# Portfolio of Kyle White
This website was built using Bootstrap components, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript plugins for animations. jQuery was used for responsiveness and compatibility with Safari. CSS breakpoints were added for compatibility with Windows, Android, iOS and MacOS devices with device pixel ratio > 1.0 (display scaling). 

Modular sections (sections with repeated card elements) were automated with JavaScript and JSON for data storage. 

CI/CD was handled through AWS Amplify.
